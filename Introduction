// After Installing and opening Python IDE,

// Basic mathematical operations like +, -, *, /, %, //, ^, ** 
// These will work directly irrespective of synatx or skeleton of java in the compiler.

10//3 output is 3 (integer division)

2*2*2*2 is also written as 2**4 output is 16

10/3 output is 3.33333333335 (actual division)

10%3 output is 1 (remainder)

// We can use some pre-defined fuctions or own functions to code

print('python') output is python
just simply 'python' output is 'python'

use " " for group of strings or characters
example : "python's code"

print("hello world")
output: 'hello world'

the string part must be different from outside part
example : print('"python" code') here python is highlited
output is "python" code

but when u want to print ram's and highlighted one
we use \ backslash which will ignore the special character next to it.
print('ram\'s "python code"')
output is: ram's "python code"

// print python 5 times
5*'python'
output: pythonpythonpythonpythonpython

print('c:\docs:\navin')  // here \n has new meaning it will move to new line
output: c:\docs:
        avin
         
print(r'c:\docs:\navin')    // here r means raw string...it will consider whole thing as one and do
output: c:\docs:\navin
